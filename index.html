                <p> (Q.1)What Does Web Programming Mean?</p>
                Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web
                content, Web client and server scripting and network security.
                <br><br>
                The most common languages used for Web
                programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP.
                <br><br> Web programming is different from just
                programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server
                scripting, and database technology.

                <div class="q2">
                    <p>(Q.2)Is Web Development Right For Me?</p>>
                    When tech enthusiasts eventually decide to make the switch to tech, they quickly realize that the
                    industry is a very big playing field, covering wide areas of specialization, such as Web
                    Development, Mobile Apps Development, Machine Learning, Data Science, Graphics Design,
                    Cybersecurity, Games Development and much more.
                    <br><br>
                    With such a large number of options, there is the tendency to be unsure of which specific career
                    path to follow.
                    <br><br>
                    The fellow, who is interested in making a career in tech, has to grapple with the problem of
                    choosing a particular career pathway.

                            <p>THE ANTIDOTE TO SELF DOUBT!!</p>
                        </u>
                        Now that we have taken a brief look at the six major causes of doubt that aspiring web
                        developers face, let us now investigate the several dependencies, which when combined together,
                        make up the cure for self-doubt. <br><br>
                        <h3>1.>>ITEM ONE- Right Understanding</h3>
                        The first step to freedom from self-doubt is to understand that you are human, and thus, it is
                        normal to have them. <br> This means that you should not beat up yourself whenever you notice
                        them
                        arising in your mind. <br><br>
                        Be that as it may, you also need to understand that your doubts are not something to shy away
                        from; rather, they are monsters which must be confronted and defeated. <br><br>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <h3>2.>>ITEM TWO- Do Your Research</h3>
                            When you are trying to decide on a specific career path in tech, it is highly imperative
                            that you conduct research on the <b><i> options that are of interest to you.</i></b><br>
                            Indeed, knowing exactly what the different tech fields entail, can enable you to determine
                            which of them will be the best fit for you. <br><br>
                            <b><i>Research is also very necessary when you are trying to choose a particular technology
                                    stack.</i></b>
                            You need to know which technologies are dying out and which ones are most likely to keep on
                            bubbling for a long time to come. You cannot afford to be blind when choosing a set of tools
                            and technologies to learn. <br><br>
                            In short, correct information that is gained from high-quality research can go a long way in
                            dispelling any doubt you might be facing.
